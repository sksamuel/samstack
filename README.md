# samstack

This is a template project you can clone and use as a basis for your own Kotlin based microservices.

This application structure is my personal preference. I do not claim this is the _best_ approach (whatever
that means), but simply that it works for me and has seen success at several companies I have worked at. This is an
**opinionated project** and as such will not appeal to all.

I am a _mild_ functional programming advocate, and my viewpoints are influenced by functional programming,
but try to avoid the more advanced FP features that don't translate well to Kotlin.

## Opinions

* No dependency injection. You simply do not need it.
   * It is trivial to pass dependencies through the constructor. Services should be small enough that you don't have
     layers upon layers of "services" where passing dependencies around becomes a burden.
   * When you use constructors as they were intended, you never have to try and work out where a "bean" is being
     instantiated.
* Config as data classes.
   * Easy to test because you can simply create the config values you want in tests and pass in an instance of the data
     class.
   * No confusion as to where values are being pulled from.
* Tests should be real tests
   * No mocks. Ever. You don't need them (caveat - you might need them in some tiny edge cases, like testing a legacy
     Java interface with 200 methods).
   * Test your endpoints by using a framework that treats requests as simple objects.
   * Use [test containers](https://testcontainers.com/) for real databases.
   * Use embedded HTTP servers for upstream dependencies.
* Functional error handling
   * Don't throw exceptions unless it's truly exceptional. Expected errors, such as invalid json, are not exceptional.
   * Use Kotlin's [Result](https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-result/) structure to capture errors.
* Avoid interfaces for services and datastores
   * You don't need an interface for your database code. You're not going to need to mock them, and the logic is
     bespoke.
   * A good rule of thumb in my opinion is, if you have an implementation of an interface called `MyInterfaceImpl` then
     you don't need the interface because you have no natural name for the implementation.

* Avoid ORMs
   * Unless you have a ton of CRUD to write, it's easier to just write SQL by hand.
   * Spring JDBC Template is a simple set of helpers around JDBC calls.
* Don't use Strings for all your types
   * Avoid so called stringy-typed development.

## Libraries

* Kotlin - Running the latest Kotlin release.
* [ktor](https://ktor.io/) a Jetbrains Kotlin based HTTP framework that natively supports coroutines. Provides
  http-as-a-function (almost), and a great in-memory test server. Lacks swagger integration.
* [Hoplite](https://github.com/sksamuel/hoplite) a Kotlin data-class-as-config loader that provides cascading
  fallback of config files. Config is loaded in regular data classes that you define and can pass about. This allows for
  easy testing, as you can provide test-time values by simply creating instances of those data classes.
* [Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest) Kotlin test framework that supports nested test layout, coroutines,
  idiomatic Kotlin assertions, test-container extensions, property testing, data driven testing, non-deterministic
  helpers, and more.
* [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) Metrics collection with integration with datadog / grafana, etc and most Java
  libraries come with Micrometer adapters to collect metrics.
  many/most Java libraries.
* [Hikari](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) High performance and robust JDBC pooling library. The go-to
  JVM based connection pool library in 2022.
* [Tabby](https://github.com/sksamuel/tabby) - a tiny functional programming accessory kit. Essentially a set of
  extension functions for `Result` that help fill in the gaps on Result.
* [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) - a functional programming accessory kit. Useful for resource management.
* [Kotlin Logging](https://github.com/MicroUtils/kotlin-logging) - a simple project that wraps slf4j but makes it easier
  to define a kotlin logger as a top level function.
* [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) - a simple alternative to log4j.
* [Cohort](https://github.com/sksamuel/cohort) A spring-actuator style plugin for Ktor. Useful for probes for
  kubernetes services.
* [Tribune](https://github.com/sksamuel/tribune) A validation library for Kotlin that takes the "parse don't
  validate" approach.
* [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org) Creates disposable containers for tests, so you don't need to mock
  database code, because you can test against the real thing.
* [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) Versioned database migrations, that you can also apply to your tests.
* [Spring JDBC Template](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html)
  Small set of helpers for working with JDBC calls.

## Structure

* `App` is your 'god' object. It contains config parsed by Hoplite, a Micrometer registry backed by datadog, a
  database `java.sql.DataSource`. Any dependencies you need to share should be created here.
   * The micrometer registry comes preconfigured with JVM metrics such as memory, cpu and diskspace.
   * The datasource is backed by a Hikari connection pool. Configure defaults in the database.yml files.
* `main` - This is the starter function that sets some defaults and launches ktor
* `module` - this contains a single logical grouping of ktor endpoints and plugins.

## Modules

* template-domain - place your domain classes here so they are shared between datastores and services
* template-datastore - place your database or cache repositories here
* template-services - place your business logic and endpoints here
* template-client - create a reusable client here for internal services to use
* template-app - an assembly module that builds a docker image for deployment. Config files and logging configuration
  lives here.

## Config

We define a base file, called application.yml which contains defaults that don't change between environments. For
example, port numbers or cache ttls.

Then we have a separate file per environment in the format `application-ENV.yml` eg `application-staging.yml`

This app uses the powerful data-class-as-config approach from Hoplite. Files are loaded in a cascading fashion - earlier
files (as defined in App) override values in later files. The file are converted to data classes and any missing values
or conversion errors are immediately flagged on startup.

AWS secrets manager support is enabled by adding a config key in the form `secretsmanager//:mykey` which you can see
in `application-prod.yml` for example.

## Running

Startup docker `docker-compose up` from the root of this project. This will start up a mysql database.

Run the `main` method located in the app module. This starts up a HTTP interface on the port defined
in `application.yml`. This ktor based http server is configured to return JSON
using [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).

Three endpoints are included:

* [/health](http://0.0.0.0:10800/health) returns a 200 OK suitable for use in k8
* [/random](http://0.0.0.0:10800/random) returns a random `Wibble` instance
* [/database](http://0.0.0.0:10800/database) returns all _wibbles_ from the database (you need to create the wibble
  table and add your own wibble!)

```sql
CREATE TABLE wibble (
   a TEXT,
   b INT
);

INSERT INTO wibble (a, b)
VALUES ("foo", 1),
       ("bar", 2 ");
```

## Deployments

Executing `./gradlew dockerBuildImage` will build a docker image ready for deployment.
